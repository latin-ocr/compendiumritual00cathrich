to all his posterity and from every other sin that may
have been committed before its reception. It nuparts
to the 50111 a new and spiritual life which 601151515 111
an intimate union 111111 God by saith, hope and charit-y,
and imprints on it a charactel which consecrates it in
a special manner to his service, and entitles it to all
the blessings that have been purchased for us by the
sufferings of Jesus Christ. But these graces, as I
before observed, require a correspondent fidelity on
our part and impose great obligations. “If thou wilt
enter life, says our Saviour, keep the commandments.”
It does not suffice to have been honored with the
christian character, or to believe speculatively the
truths of revelation; one of the primary objects of
religion is to reform the heart as well as to instruct
the understanding. Hence the solemnity of the rite
employed by the Church in the administration of bap-
tism. The sacred unction by which we are conse-
crated to the service of the Almighty, the sign of the
cross reminding us of the saith 116 profess, the various
exorcisms in 11111611 1116 evil spirit is commanded to
depart f1 om the 50111, 1116 white garment presented to
us as an emblem of the sanctity of a christian life, the
burning taper which represents the light of virtue that
should ev er shine forth in our actions, all concur to
impiess upon our minds the important obligation we
contract, of renouncino· 1116 ways of sin and imitating
the example of our Divine Saviour. Such aie 1116
happy effects of that holy ceremony which you are
about to witness. Such are the blessings to be con-
ferred on this child and in some degree upon us all,
if we 1111 oke them with fervor and sincerity at the
throne of grace. May we then de1ive from this occa-
51011 1116 many advantages which it is calculated to
impart. May it be for us a time of conversion, or at
least of renovation in the practice of duty, that the
sacred character 11111611 we have received, may prove
to us a source of happiness 111 11115 life and of endless
enjoyment in the life to come.
