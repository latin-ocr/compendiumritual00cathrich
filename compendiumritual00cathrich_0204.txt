ADMINISTRATION OF THE SACRAMENTS.

EXHORTATION BEFORE BAPTISM.

APTISM is one of the seven sacraments insti-

tuted by our Divine Saviour for the purpose of
communicating his grace to the soul of man. It is
the first and most essential of the sacraments and
absolutely necessary for salvation. “Unless a man
be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he can-
not enter into the kingdom of God.” Hence it is of
the utmost importance that christian parents should
have their children presented in due time for the
reception of this holy rite, lest, by an unnecessary
and imprudent delay, they be deprived of the inesti-
mable blessings attached to it. The effects which
baptism produces in the soul are most admirable, and
cannot be too frequently the subject of your reflec-
tions. It is not a mere favor bestowed on man by his
Creator, the advantages of which he may enjoy at his
pleasure or forfeit with impunity3 it is a mutual en-
gagement, a sacred alliance between God and the
soul, which leads him to shower upon us his choicest
gifts and obligates us to serve him with fidelity. By
this holy ceremony we are purified from that original
guilt which has been transmitted by our first parent
