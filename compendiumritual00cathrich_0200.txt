“ I also admit the holy Scripturas, according to that
“ sense which our holy Mother, the Church, has held,
“ and does hold, to whom it belongs to judge of the
“ true sense and interpretation of the Scriptures ι
“ neither will Ι ever take and interpret themrpther-
“ wise, than according to the unanimous consent of
“ the Fathers.”

“ Ι also profess, that there are truly and properly
“ seven sacramente, of the new law, instituted by Jesus
“ Christ our Lord, and necessary for the salvation of
“mankind, though not all for every one: io wit,
“ Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist, mezoe, Eaetreme
“ Unction, Ονςῖθν, and Matrimony3 and that they con-
“ fer grace3 and that of these, Baptism, Confirmacion,
“ and Orde7‘‚ cannot be reiterated without sacrilege.
“ Ι also receive and admit the received and approved
“ ceremonies of the Catlzolic Chardi, used in the
“ solemn administration of all the aforesaid saera-
“ ments.”

‘⁶ Ι embrace and receive all and *every one of the
“ things which have been defined and declared in the
“ holy council of Trent, concerning original sin (md
“ justificationffl

“ Ι profess, likewise, that in the mass there is
‘⁶ offered to God a true, proper, and propitiatory
“ sacrifice for the living and the dead. And that in
“ the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist, there is
“ busy, really, and substantiallzs, the body and blood,
“together with the 80th and divinity of our Lord
“ Jesus Christ: and that thele is made a conversion
“ of the whole substance of the bread into the body,
“and of the whole substance of the wine into the
“ bl00d3 which conveision the Cathol‘zc Church calls
“ Transicbstantiation. I also confess, that under either
“ kind alone, Christ is received whole and entire, and
“ a true sacrament.” ⁴

“ I constantly hold, that there is a purgatory, and
“ that the souls thercin detained are helped by the
“ suffrages of the faithful.”
