EXHORTATION BEFORE CHURCHING.

N conformity to a very laudable eustorii, you have

come to request the blessing of the Church upon
yourself and the child that has been committed to
your care. W hile you return thanks to God sor the
favors which he has bestowed upon you, let them ln-
duce you to make a fei vent consecration of yourself
and your offs spring to his holy service. Be careful,
both by word and example, to impiess upon its youth-
ful heart the plinciples of solid piety, that you may
correspond to the views of Divine Providence in
placing it under your charge, and may have the hap-
piness of seeing your childien attentive in their (luties
to God, and solicitous for their own eternal welfare.
You hold a lighted candle in your hand, to signify
the good works by which you should express your
gratitude to God for the benefits which he has con-
ferred on you, and the pious example by which you
should lead your children and all aiound you to the
love and practice of virtue. Endeavor to enter into
this disposition, and to cultivate it all the days of
your life, that you may obtain and enjoy the blessings
which I am now about to solicit for you in the name

of the Church.
