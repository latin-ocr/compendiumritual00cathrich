not of a transient and momentary nature3 it will bi'nd
you together during the whole period of your earthly
existence: for, “what God hath joined, says the
Scriptum, let not man put asunder. '³ As nothing but
death will be able to dissolve the union that ι5 to exist
between you, it is of the highest importance that you
should implore at this moment that blessing of Divine
Providence, without which you would m vain promise
yourselves any real happiness. Whatever may be
your pres sent anticipations, whatever the tie of affec-

tion that binds you to each other, the time of diffi-

culty, the moment of trial must arrive, when all the
courage of a geneious heart and all the piety of a true
christian will be requisite to sustain you, to enlighten
you, and to protect from the sury of the storin the fair
fruits of domestic peace. It is ythis that awakens a
feeling of the deepest interest among those who sur-

roundb you on this occasion, and prompts us all to
invoke upon you the favor of the Almighty. May he
then extend to you those graces which will be the
security os your earthly hap ppiness, and a pledge of
your eternal welf-aie· But for your part, let me.
entreat you to be ever mindful of the holiness of the
matrimoni-al state, and to animate yourselves by this
consideiati on to a faithful discharge of your obliga-

tiens. May you never lose sight of those sacred pro-

mises which you aie about to utter as the basis of
your confidence in each other, nor of that mutual
fidelity which you now profeSS‚ and which' is so strik-

ino gly represented by the ring which is used in this
eeremony as the seal of your lasting and happy union.

Let religion direct you in all your actions, and you
will not be disappointed in your hopes. Itwill qualify
you to be the support and comfort of each othei in the
various trials which you will experience‚ it will pro-

mote your happiness here, and prepare you for more.
permanent enjoyments hereafter.
