AFTER THE MVARRIAGE CEREMONY.

AVING been united in the holx⁷ hands of matri- ,

mony, give thanks to the Almighty for the
favors which he has bestowed upon you. The graces
which you have received have been granted for the
purpose of animating you in the discharge of the obli-
* gations which the marriage life imposes, and which are
beautifully expressed in these words of the Apostle:
“Let women be subJect to their husbands, as to the-
Lord3 for the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ
is the head of the Church. . . . Therefore, as the Church
is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their
husbands in all things. Husbands‚ love your wives, as
Christ also loved the Church, and delivered himself
up for it, that he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the
laver of water in the word of life . . . . So also ought
men to love their wives as their own bodies.” Ever
mindful of these duties which you owe to eac-h other,
and to those with whose welfare you may be specially
charged, cherish with solicitude the grace that has
this day been conferred upon you3 it will direct you
in every difficulty, it will comfort you in the hour of
trial, it will be a continual source of peace, of joy, of·
mutual affection on earth, and a pledge of your eternal
and perfect union in heaven.
