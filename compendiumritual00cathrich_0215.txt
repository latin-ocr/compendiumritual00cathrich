EXHORTATION BEFORE EXTREME
UNCTION.

OUR Divine Saviour has been pleased in his infi-
nite goodness to institute, besides the holy com-
munion, another sacrament for the spiritual and cor·
poral benefit of those who are ‹langerously ill. It is
that of Extremo Unction, which is clearly pointed out
in those words of St. James: “Is any man sick among
you P Let him bring in the priests of the Church‚ and
let them pray over him, anointing him with oil‚ in the
name of the Lord3 and the prayer of faith shall save
the sick man3 and if he be in sins, they shall be
forgiven him.” To receive the graces prepared for
you in this heavenly institution, be sorry from your
heart for having offended God who has provided you
with so great a comfort in your present state of infir-
mity. Every portion of your being calls for support
at this moment. Your body and soul are equally in
need of the heavenly physician3 the one is reduced
to an extreme weakness by the violence of disease,
the other has become languid and depressed3 and in
this state of dejection you are more than ever exposed
to the assaults of your spiritual enemy. To supply
these urgent wants is the object of Extreme Unction.
It will banish from you the enemy of salvation, and
afford you an easy triumph over his wicked sugges-
tions3 if it be expedient for your spiritual welfare, it
will diminish your pains and restore you to health3 it
will obtain for you the remissiori of your sins; in a
word, it will enable you to persevere to the end, and
secure to you the happiness of a good death. Cast
your eyes then upon the Cross, (ltere slzew the Gru-
czfioe.) the image of your crucified Redeemer3 enter
into the sentiments with which he suffered for the sins
of the world3 endure your illness with patience and
‘resignation to the will of God, as a penance justly
due to your offences3 and while l apply this sacred
