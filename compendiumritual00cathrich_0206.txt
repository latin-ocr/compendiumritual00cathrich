AFTER BAPTISM.

ET us return oui· fervent thanks to God sor the
blessings which he has bestowed upon this child.
It has been numbered among the favorites of heaven
and associated with the mystical body of Christ. Let
us pray that the grace which it has received, may be
its protection during life, aud guard it securely from
all the dangers to which it will be exposed in the way
of salvation. It will, indeed, be the safeguard of its
innocence and a pledge of eternal happiness, if you
who have been charged with its welfare, are solicitous
to cultivate these first impressions of virtue. To do
this by wholesome instruction, by a religious educa-
tion, and particularly by the influence of good exam·
ple, is one of the principal duties of a christian parent.
Should circumstances require it, the same office de-
volves secondarily upon the godfather and godmother,
who are the spiritual guardians of the child and are
responsible for its instruction in the principles of the
Catholic saith. Ι must not omit to inform you like-
wise, that the sponsors contract a spiritual affinity
with the child and its parents which is an impedi-
ment to marriage, but they contract no affinity with
each other. May you who have assumed this lmpor-
tant charge, be ever mindful of your obligations, and
by zealously promoting the salvation of those who
have been confided to your cale, merit for yourselves
the crown of everlasting life.
