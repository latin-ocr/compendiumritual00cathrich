man, Ο Lord! that thou art mindful of him, or the
Son of man that thou visitest him.” While you
acknowledge your unworthiness that he should enter
under your roos, let your beart expand at the contem-
plation of his goodness, ardently desiring to be united
to him, and to make him the only object of your affec·
tions for time and eternity.

AFTER COMMUNION.

NDEAVOR, my dear friend, to set to profit
the precious moments, during which the Lord of
heaven and earth will deign to abide corporally within
you. You possess him who created you, who redeemed
you, and who has destined you to a glorious immor-
tality. What blessings may you not expect to receive
from him after this signal testimony of his incompre-
hensible love? Give vent therefore to the liveliest
emotions of gratitude for the incomparable favor which
he has bestowed upon you, and while you invite all
creatures to join you in praise and thanksgiving, en-
treat him to remain with you for ever, to protect you
against all your spiritual enemies, to grant you those
sentiments of resignation to his holy will, that spirit
os penance and disengagement from the things of this
life, which will render your sufferings meritorious,
and inspire you with confidence at any moment he
may call upon you to leave this world. What have
you to sear with this heavenly protector at your side?
Under his guidance, you may truly say in the words
of the royal Prophet‚ “though I should walk in the
midst of the shadow of death, I will sear no evils, for
thou art with me.” Let this be the subject of your
reflections, and it will prove a source of great conso*
lation during life as well as at the hour of death.
