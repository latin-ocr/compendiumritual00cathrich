after repeated exorcisms to expel the evil spirit, the
person is conducted from the entrance to the interior
of the chureh, where he makes a solemn profession of
the christian saith, and his ears and nostrils are
touched with spittle in imitation of our Saviour‚ when
he cured the deas and dumb man, the priest at the
same time saying, ephpheta, “be thou opened,’' to sig-
nify that the senses of the soul should be ever open to
the truth and the grace of God. To a solemn renun-
ciation of the devil and all his pomps and works, suc-

administered by pouring consecrated water on the
head of the person, with the words ordained by
Christ: I baptize thebin tlte name of the Fatlier, ancl
ofthe Son, [md of tae Holy Glzost. The new christian
is then anointed on the top of the head with the sacred
chrism, as an emblem ot the eminent character which
he has received, and of his special consecration to the
service of God. After this, a white garment is laid
upon him, to denote the robe of innocence with which
he is clothed in baptism, and lastly a burning light is
put into his hand to signify the lamp of faith which he
is always to keep burning with the oil of charity and
good works, that he may be ever ready to go forth and
meet the heavenly bridegroom, and be admitted to
that happy nuptial feast which will have no end. In
witnessing these ceremonies, by which we ourselves
were consecrated to the service of the Almighty, let
us recall with gratitude the eminent blessings which
lie has conferred upon us, and implore the grace of
faithfully corresponding to his mercies.
